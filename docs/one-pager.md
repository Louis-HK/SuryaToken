# SuryaToken One-Pager

## Executive Summary  
Indonesia aims to cut CO₂ emissions by 29% by 2030 while still relying heavily on coal. SuryaToken aligns capital with measurable green impact by tokenizing verified renewable energy generation and applying dynamic incentive curves, stabilized by a treasury layer. The system creates transparent, programmable impact credits that unlock new liquidity for sustainable transition.

## Key Metrics (example placeholders)
- **Target Emissions Reduction**: 29% by 2030  
- **Max Token Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SYT  
- **Initial Treasury Reserve**: 20% (200M SYT)  
- **Producer Allocation**: 50% (500M SYT)  
- **Reward Cap**: 200 SYT per MWh (dynamic based on regional urgency)  
- **Stabilization Threshold**: ±15% price deviation triggers treasury action  

## Core Mechanisms
- **Incentive Layer**: Minting SYT based on verified energy data.  
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Higher issuance where impact gap is larger.  
- **Treasury Stabilization**: Buybacks or supplemental issuance to keep economic balance.  
- **Transparency**: Public dashboard + on-chain auditability.

## Immediate Milestones
- Draft whitepaper published (v0.1)  
- Tokenomics simulator baseline running  
- Smart contract prototype (mint + reward curve)  
- Testnet issuance pilot
