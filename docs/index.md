# SuryaToken One-Pager

## Executive Summary  
Indonesia aims to cut COâ‚‚ emissions by 29% by 2030 while still relying heavily on coal. SuryaToken aligns capital with measurable green impact by tokenizing verified renewable energy generation and applying dynamic incentive curves, stabilized by a treasury layer. The system creates transparent, programmable impact credits that unlock new liquidity for the sustainable transition.

## Key Metrics (example placeholders)
- **Target Emissions Reduction**: 29% by 2030  
- **Max Token Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SYT  
- **Initial Treasury Reserve**: 20% (200M SYT)  
- **Producer Allocation**: 50% (500M SYT)  
- **Reward Cap**: 200 SYT per MWh (dynamic based on regional urgency)  
- **Stabilization Threshold**: Â±15% price deviation triggers treasury intervention  
- **Governance Readiness**: parameter updates subject to timelocks and stakeholder review  

## Core Mechanisms
- **Incentive Layer**: Minting SYT based on verified renewable energy generation (on-chain issuance tied to real-world data).  
- **Dynamic Rewards**: Higher token issuance where the impact gap is larger, via urgency-adjusted reward curves.  
- **Treasury Stabilization**: Reserve-backed interventions (buybacks or supplemental issuance) to absorb shocks and maintain economic balance.  
- **Data Validation / Oracles**: Multi-source energy data ingestion with fallback, sanity checks, and attestations.  
- **Transparency**: Public dashboard, immutable issuance logs, and audit trails for all key flows.

## Immediate Milestones
- âœ… Draft whitepaper published (v0.1)  
- âœ… One-pager summary live  
- ðŸŸ§ Tokenomics simulator baseline implemented  
- ðŸŸ§ Smart contract prototype (mint + reward curve) in development  
- â¬œ Testnet issuance pilot with mock energy feed  
- â¬œ Treasury shock testing and stabilization logic validation  

## Strategic Vision
SuryaToken is the foundational economic layer for green infrastructure in Indonesia, enabling:
- Impact-aligned capital deployment from institutional and ESG investors.  
- Integration with larger systems (e.g., Submarine Space for sustainable habitat financing).  
- Scalable regional rollout with governance evolving toward community/stakeholder participation.

## How It Works (simplified)
1. **Energy Data Collection** â€“ Renewable generation metrics are collected, validated and attested via oracle pipelines.  
2. **Reward Computation** â€“ Dynamic reward curve calculates SYT issuance per MWh, factoring regional urgency and current gap to targets.  
3. **Token Minting** â€“ SYT are minted and distributed to producers, stakers, or reserve based on the model.  
4. **Stabilization Feedback** â€“ Treasury monitors price/velocity and adjusts issuance or executes buybacks when needed.  
5. **Visibility & Audit** â€“ All actions surface on public dashboards; stakeholders can verify impact and governance changes.

## Next Steps / Call to Action
- Finalize and audit smart contract logic  
- Launch testnet pilot with real or semi-verified energy partners  
- Enable early impact investor onboarding via tokenized green credits  
- Build governance primitive (parameter proposal + timelock)  
- Public dashboard launch & regional expansion planning
