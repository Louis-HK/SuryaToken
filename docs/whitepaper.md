# SuryaToken Whitepaper

## 1. Executive Summary  
Indonesia faces a dual challenge: rapid economic growth with heavy reliance on coal, and urgent climate commitments to reduce CO₂ emissions by 29% by 2030. SuryaToken is a blockchain-native incentive infrastructure that aligns capital flows with measurable decarbonization outcomes. By tokenizing verified renewable energy generation and creating dynamic reward mechanisms, SuryaToken creates a transparent, programmable bridge between green energy producers, impact capital, and stakeholders.  

Key outcomes:  
- Tokenized green credits tied to real energy generation.  
- Dynamic incentive curves that prioritize regions with highest marginal impact.  
- Treasury-backed stabilization to maintain trust and functional economic flow.  
- Governance-ready architecture for scaling and stakeholder participation.

## 2. Market & Context  
- **Energy Profile**: Indonesia is heavily dependent on coal (~60% of electricity) despite abundant renewable potential.  
- **Emission Targets**: Government commitment to reduce emissions 29% by 2030.  
- **Gap**: Traditional carbon markets and subsidies are opaque, slow, and poorly aligned with real-time impact.  
- **Opportunity**: Blockchain allows verifiable, real-time issuance of value (SuryaTokens) for measurable green activity, unlocking new impact liquidity (impact funds, corporate ESG buyers, regional partners).

## 3. Architecture  
SuryaToken is composed of layered modules:

### 3.1 Incentive Layer  
Smart contracts issuing SuryaTokens based on validated renewable energy generation.  
- Input: energy metrics (e.g., MWh)  
- Conversion: energy → token via reward curve  
- Output: tokens minted to producers, stakers, or treasury pool.

### 3.2 Oracle / Data Validation  
Energy generation data is ingested from trusted sources, passed through sanity filters, and optionally attested (signature, redundancy). Fallback mechanisms ensure resilience.

### 3.3 Tokenomics Simulator  
Off-chain Python engine that simulates issuance, circulation, treasury behavior, and economic stress scenarios before on-chain parameterization.

### 3.4 Treasury & Stabilization  
Reserve pool (fiat-backed or collateralized) buffers token volatility. Stabilization policy adjusts issuance or activates buyback mechanisms when deviations exceed thresholds.

### 3.5 Dashboard & Transparency  
Public dashboard exposes: energy verified, tokens issued, regional impact, treasury health, and governance changes.

## 4. Token Economics  

### 4.1 Token Types
- **SuryaToken (SYT)**: Primary reward token representing a unit of verified green impact.  
- **Governance Stake/Utility Layer (optional)**: Future extension for participants who vote on parameter updates.

### 4.2 Supply Model (example)
- **Max supply**: 1,000,000,000 SYT  
- **Initial reserve (treasury)**: 20% (200M) – used for stabilization & bootstrap incentives  
- **Producer rewards**: 50% (500M) – issued over time based on verified energy  
- **Ecosystem / Partners**: 15% (150M) – strategic onboarding, integrations  
- **Development & Governance**: 10% (100M) – protocol evolution, maintenance  
- **Incentive buffer / emergency**: 5% (50M)

### 4.3 Reward Curve (illustrative)
Reward per MWh is dynamic:  

- If a region is behind emission reduction target, its urgency_factor >1 increases token reward.  
- Caps enforce no more than 200 SYT per MWh to avoid runaway issuance.  
- Curve parameters are stored on-chain with time delays for governance updates.

### 4.4 Treasury Stabilization
- **Price deviation trigger**: If market-implied value of SYT diverges ±15% from target impact peg, treasury executes:  
  - Buyback when oversupplied  
  - Supplemental rewards when under-incentivized  
- **Buffer modeling**: Simulated in the tokenomics engine to ensure >30 days of shock absorbency under stress scenarios.

## 5. Governance & Stakeholders  
- **Stakeholders**: Energy producers, impact investors, treasury stewards, strategic partners (e.g., Submarine Space).  
- **Governance primitives**: Parameter proposal system, emergency pause, reward curve adjustments.  
- **Future DAO layer**: Community-aligned governance for scale beyond initial trusted operators.

## 6. Implementation Plan & Phases  
See section 9 for detailed roadmap. Phases:  
1. Prototype & simulation  
2. Testnet pilot with select producers  
3. Treasury integration & stabilization logic  
4. Governance layer launch  
5. Regional expansion  

## 7. Impact Measurement  
- CO₂ offset accounting: Conversion factors from energy generation to emission reduction.  
- Verification cadence: periodic audits of data source, oracle integrity.  
- Transparency: Immutable issuance records + public impact dashboard.

## 8. Risk & Mitigation  
- **Oracle failure**: Dual-source failover + alerting  
- **Economic divergence**: Treasury buffer + governance pause  
- **Adoption inertia**: Early strategic incentives, partner onboarding thesis  
- **Security**: Smart contract audits, multisig for governance-critical actions
